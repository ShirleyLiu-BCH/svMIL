class NeighborhoodDefiner:
	"""
		Class responsible for defining the neighborhood of causal genes.
		
		Currently, the neighborhood consists of:
		
		- nearest TADs on the left and right of the gene
		- all eQTLs mapped to the gene (and if these are enhancers or not)
		- SVs overlapping either the gene directly, or other elements in the neighborhood
