Folder containing genomic positions of eQTLs for different tissue types and the genes that these are linked to.

Sources:
breast_eQTLs.bed: generated by running DataProcessing/filterEQTLsForCausalGenes.py on the GTEx multi-tissue file
(https://storage.googleapis.com/gtex_analysis_v7/multi_tissue_eqtl_data/GTEx_Analysis_v7.metasoft.txt.gz). Filtered for breast tissue (pval_Breast_Mammary_Tissue) and all eQTLs with a pValue < 5e-8.
Pvalues of 0 were accepted. 
ovarian_eQTLs.bed: generated in the same way as breast_eQTLs.txt, but then for ovarian tissue (pval_Ovary).
prostate_eQTLs.bed: generated in the same way as ovarian_eQTLs.txt, but for prostate tissue (pval_Prostate).
