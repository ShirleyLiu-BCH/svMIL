# integrative-omics
Variant annotation and prioritization

Running the code:

```
python main.py ../data/TPTNTestSet/TP.txt ../output/TP_annotations.txt
```


To do:

- The wiki needs a page with details about the used datasets (everything in the data folder) and what these data mean
- Also add information about external datasets to the wiki
